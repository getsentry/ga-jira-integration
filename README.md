# Create JIRA issues from Github Issues

Whenever you assign a label to your Github issue and that label matches `TRIGGER_LABEL` from the action configuration `.yml` file, it will trigger this action which will result in a JIRA issue on your JIRA board.

# Usage

As for any Github action, you have to create an `.github/workflows` folder and a yaml file for each workflow configuration you want to have. Most of the time, you need only one workflow for this.

Here is a simple setup:

```yaml
name: Create JIRA issue

on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  createIssue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: getsentry/ga-jira-integration@main
        with:
          JIRA_API_HOST: ${{secrets.JIRA_API_HOST}}
          JIRA_API_TOKEN: ${{secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN}}
          JIRA_EMAIL: ${{secrets.JIRA_EMAIL}}
          TRIGGER_LABEL: Backlog
          JIRA_PROJECT_ID: TES
          JIRA_ISSUE_NAME: Story
```

> For sensitive information (secrets) in this file, it is recommended to [follow this Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) where it shows how to store secrets in GitHub. Stored secrets will be exposed to this GtiHub action.
